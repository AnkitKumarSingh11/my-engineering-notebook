# 👋 Hi, I'm Ankit Kumar

Welcome to my personal website — a space where I share what I learn, build, and experiment with across software engineering, cloud, and data systems.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Senior Member of Technical Staff currently working at Oracle Health, and based in Bengaluru, India.  
My experience spans:

- Building and scaling microservices (Spring Boot, Java, JAX-RS, Helidon)
- Working with distributed data systems (Spark, Hadoop, HBase, Avro, Parquet)
- DevOps & Cloud (OCI, AWS, GCP — Compute, DB, Load Balancing, Storage)
- Authentication & Authorization systems (Keycloak, OAuth, IAM)
- Schema management (Avro, Hortonworks Schema Registry, JPA/Hibernate)
- Building migration and integration pipelines across cloud platforms

I enjoy solving complex distributed-system problems, optimizing performance, and simplifying infrastructure setups.

## ✍️ What You'll Find Here

I use this space to document:

- 🔧 Engineering deep-dives  
- 🧪 Proof-of-concepts and experiments  
- 🗃 Data engineering patterns and setups  
- ☁️ Cloud architecture notes (OCI, AWS, GCP)  
- 🧩 Practical guides, tips, and troubleshooting  
- 💡 Thoughts on engineering, optimization, and design

If you're a backend, data, or cloud engineer, you'll probably find something useful.
