# Python

This section is for Python-focused notes: writing maintainable code, tooling, typing, testing, and performance basics.

## What this section is for

- Clean code patterns (packaging, project layout, linting/formatting)
- Type hints and static analysis (mypy/pyright-style workflows)
- Testing and automation (pytest, CI checks, fast feedback loops)
- Performance and debugging (profiling, common pitfalls)
- Python for data/ETL scripting in production contexts
