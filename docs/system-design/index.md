# System Design

This section captures system design notes: how to reason about requirements, constraints, trade-offs, and scalable architectures.

## What this section is for

- Designing services (APIs, data models, boundaries, versioning)
- Scalability patterns (caching, sharding, queues, backpressure)
- Reliability patterns (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, idempotency)
- Observability (logging, metrics, tracing, SLOs)
- Capacity planning and performance reasoning
