# PySpark

This section is for PySpark-focused notes and guides: DataFrame APIs, common ETL patterns, and day-to-day troubleshooting.

## What this section is for

- Getting started (local setup, first jobs, project structure)
- Practical DataFrame work (joins, aggregations, window functions)
- UDFs vs built-ins, pandas UDFs, and performance trade-offs
- Reading/writing data (Parquet, JSON/CSV, partitioning)
- Debugging common issues (serialization, skew, memory, jars)
