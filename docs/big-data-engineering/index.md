# Big Data Engineering

This section covers end-to-end data engineering: ingestion, pipelines, data modeling, storage, and production operations.

## What this section is for

- Building batch and streaming pipelines (design, correctness, SLAs)
- Data lake/lakehouse patterns (partitioning, compaction, small files)
- Data quality (validation, anomaly checks, schema evolution)
- Orchestration and observability (scheduling, retries, metrics, alerts)
- Cost/performance trade-offs across compute and storage
